# File Zipper Using Huffman Encoding

This project demonstrates file compression using the Huffman Coding algorithm, a loss less data compression technique. The algorithm assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies, with more frequent characters receiving shorter codes and less frequent characters receiving longer codes. This program currently supports **text** files only.

**To Compress a File:**
1. Click the "Choose File" button.
2. Select the file you want to compress.
3. Click the "Encode" button to download the encoded (compressed) text file.

**To Decompress a File:**
1. Click the "Choose File" button.
2. Select the file you want to decompress.
3. Click the "Decode" button to download the decoded (original) text file.

**To Start the Program:**
1. Ensure you have a web server with PHP support running (e.g., using XAMPP).
2. Run the PHP file by navigating to its location in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/yourproject/index.php`).
